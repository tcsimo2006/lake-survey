# lake-survey
A simulation program that analyzes islands and lakes on a grid map completed for an Assignment. Uses disjoint-set (Union-Find) data structures to identify and merge connected components of land and water, and to track topological changes over multiple “phases” of updates.

Key Features

Implements Union-Find / Disjoint-Set structures for efficient clustering.

Identifies islands, lakes, and intersecting regions on a dynamic map.

Supports multiple update phases as terrain changes.

Outputs detailed statistics for each survey phase (total islands, lakes, and combined sizes).

Technologies
